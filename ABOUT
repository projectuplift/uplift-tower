# About

[Project Uplift](http://uplift.is) is one insane mental health awareness campaign. It exists to eliminate stimga around mental health with technology, mindfulness, and play.

Uplift was created in 2012 by [Zach Valenti](http://twitter.com/zachvalenti) and primarily consists of a large neurofeedback installation that enables users to levitate a globe with their mind by relaxing ([see it in action](www.upworthy.com/when-he-found-a-way-to-manage-his-add-he-knew-he-had-to-teach-others-to-let-go)).

It was originally created to impact mental health on college campuses, where suicide is the second leading cause of death, after accidents, which are also largely associated to stress, anxiety, and depression.

The purpose of this Open Source iniative is to scale the potential impact of Uplift beyond higher education and to empower anyone interested in making a difference around mental health and inspired by this project in being a leader. We see this as critical in light of The World Health Organization [citing](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/) depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide, as of October 2015.

To date, Uplift has toured to:
- The Brooklyn Urban Garden Charter School
- Massachusetts General Hospital
- The National University of Singapore
- Union Square Park, New York City
- University of Pennsylvania
- Wesleyan University
